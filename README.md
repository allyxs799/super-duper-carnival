### Anything V3

Welcome to Anything V3 - a latent diffusion model for weebs. This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on Danbooru. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts.

Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

# Examples

**Anime Girl:**

_1girl, brown hair, green eyes, colorful, autumn, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, blue sky, falling leaves, garden_
_Steps: 50, Sampler: DDIM, CFG scale: 12, Seed: 2297466124, Size: 512x640, Model hash: 2700c435_

# Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI run anything-v3.0:

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "Linaqruf/anything-v3.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "pikachu"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./pikachu.png")
```
